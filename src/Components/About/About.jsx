            Hi, Iâ€™m Paul and I'm a junior full stack software engineer. I
            originally trained as a chemical engineer and started my career in
            the drinks industry working as a supply chain engineer. It was
            during this time that I discovered a passion for the visual side of
            front end, the technical wonder of back end and an amazement for the
            transformative ways in which technology can transform lives.
            <br />
            <br />
            On the weekends you'll catch me sipping a coffee, stuck in a good
            book or flying down the Welsh mountains on my bike!
